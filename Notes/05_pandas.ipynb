    "The `numpy` library is excellent for numerical computations, but it lacks support to handle missing data or non-omogeneous arrays. The `pandas` library is based on numpy and extends the numpy functionality, and is currently one of the most widely used tools for data manipulation, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and advanced data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most imprtant advantages are 1)Possibility to handle different type of obj\n",
    "                             2)Possibility to have arrays with missing elements addressed as NaN (important for example when I have out of range events in a run)\n",

    "In particular `pandas` features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fast and efficient `DataFrame` object for data manipulation with integrated indexing; While in np i have only integer index, panda extends to all type of index.\n",
    "* Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, HDF5);\n",
    "Eredita from np all clever way to read data. Data frame supports also multi dimensional indecis, I'm not constrained to use 2-dim indecis.\n",
    "* Convenient label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;\n",
    "* Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;\n",
    "* Smart data alignment and integrated handling of missing data;\n",
    "* Aggregating and transforming data with a powerful \"group-by\" engine; \n",
    "I can do database like operations for example aggregating subsets of database. \n",
    "* High performance merging and joining of data sets;\n",
    "* Time series-functionalities;\n",
    "* Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C.\n",
