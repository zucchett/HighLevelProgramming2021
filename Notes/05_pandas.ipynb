The `pandas` library is based on numpy and extends the numpy functionality, and is currently one of the most widely used tools for data manipulation, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and advanced data analysis tools.\n",

    "* A fast and efficient `DataFrame` object for data manipulation with integrated indexing; While in np i have only integer index, panda extends to all type of index.\n",

    "Eredita from np all clever way to read data. Data frame supports also multi dimensional indecis, I'm not constrained to use 2-dim indecis.\n",
    "* Convenient label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;\n",
    "* Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;\n",
    "* Smart data alignment and integrated handling of missing data;\n",
    "* Aggregating and transforming data with a powerful \"group-by\" engine; \n",
    "I can do database like operations for example aggregating subsets of database. \n",
    "* High performance merging and joining of data sets;\n",
    "* Time series-functionalities;\n",
    "* Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C.\n",
    "If I perform operation following the logic of the data frame they will be performed very fast\n"
