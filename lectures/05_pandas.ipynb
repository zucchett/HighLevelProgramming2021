    "* Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;\n",

    "* Aggregating and transforming data with a powerful \"group-by\" engine; \n",
    "* High performance merging and joining of data sets;\n",
    "* Time series-functionalities;\n",
